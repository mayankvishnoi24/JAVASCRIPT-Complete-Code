# javaScript Data Type

## Primitive Data Types:

> **Number:** Represents numeric values. It can be an integer or a floating-point number.

> **String:** Represents sequences of characters. It is enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").

> **Boolean:** Represents either true or false. It is used for logical operations and conditional statements.

> **Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

> **Undefined:** Represents an uninitialized variable or an object property that does not exist.

> **Symbol:** Represents a unique and immutable value that can be used as an identifier for object properties.

## Complex Data Types:

> **Array:** Represents an ordered list of values. Arrays can contain any combination of data types and are created using square brackets [ ].

> **Object:** Represents a collection of key-value pairs and is used to store more complex data. Objects can be created using the new Object( ) syntax or object literals { }.

> **Function:** Represents a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can be defined using the function keyword or as arrow functions (( ) => { }).

## Array methods

```
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

const found = array1.find((element) => element > 10);

console.log(found);
// Expected output: 12
```
